1. ingest data to streams
    - The steam should have this specifications h.264 codec , <=1080p res and 25fps 
    - command ffmped -i $video -vf "fps=25" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy $output_video
    - send video to google vertex ai stream 
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="vertexvision.json"
        vaictl -p sanskaraai          -l us-central1          -c application-cluster-0          --service-endpoint visionai.googleapis.com send video-file to streams crowd-manage   --file-path send1.mp4 --loop
    - sending file into the application instead of stream
    
2. get stream from the ai model
configure adk to use vertex ai - test it 
3. outputl visualization / get stream from ingest stream
4. google maps point to point route direction
5. how llm's access the realtime video feed analytics
6. given an event map plan the camera placement, commanders placemnet, conjution points detections and plan to mitigate that.
7. how the dispatch of commanders happen when an accident happens - let each cam has geo location , commanders has geo loc , using maps for the path calc
8. given an image and using realtime video feed and data in vertex warehouse , scan for the face
9. anomaly detection practical example
